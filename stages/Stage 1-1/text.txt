[SiegeNormal] Hello, and welcome to Siege Game (tentative).
[SiegeEnigmatic] I am your playable character, Siege. Gang leader, and highest-rank Vanguard at Rhodes Island.
[SiegeEnigmatic] Yorushiku.
[SiegeNormal] This is the first stage, and the first tutorial.
[SiegeNormal] First, let's walk over to the large "?", and we will get started.

[SiegeNormal] Great job. Now we can get started.
[SiegeNormal] Let's start with something simple. Jump over this small obstacle, and then the gap, with "Space".

[SiegeEnigmatic] Fantastic job. Next, we have a wall that is too high to jump over normally.
[SiegeEnigmatic] In order to jump higher and get more air, I can attack the [green] bounce pads and bounce away from them.
[SiegeEnigmatic] Let's try attacking the [green] bounce pad with "E", and see if we can bounce over the obstacle and finish the level!
