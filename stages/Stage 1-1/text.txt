[SiegeSmile] Hello, and welcome to the tutorial of Siege Game (tentative).
[SiegeSmile] I am your playable character, Siege. Gang leader, and highest-rank Vanguard at Rhodes Island.
[SiegeClosedSmile] Yorushiku.
[SiegeNormal] This is the first stage, and the first tutorial.
[SiegeLookingAway] First, let's walk over to the large "?", and we will get started.

[SiegeClosed] Excellent. Now we can get started.
[SiegeLookingAway] Let's start with something simple. Jump over this small obstacle, and then the gap, with "Space".

[SiegeEnigmatic] Fantastic job. Next, we have a wall that is too high to jump over normally.
[SiegeEnigmatic] In order to jump higher and get more air, I can attack the [green] bounce pads and bounce away from them.
[SiegeEnigmatic] Let's try attacking the [green] bounce pad with "E", and see if we can bounce over the obstacle.
[break] break
[SiegeEnigmatic] Excellent!
[SiegeNormal] This attacking move is the main way you will interact with your environment. 
[SiegeClosed] For example, you can attack these text prompters to have them play their text again.
[SiegeAngry] Next, let's use the same attacking move ("E") to break these destructable blocks to the right.

[SiegeNormal] Great. Now, there is only one more thing left to teach.
[SiegeClosed] Basically, when you hold the space button instead of tapping it, it will cause me to get much more air.
[SiegeLookingAway] Let's use this method to get on the platform up and to the left of this wall.
[break] break
[SiegeClosedSmile] Congratulations on completing the tutorial! Move left to finish the level.
